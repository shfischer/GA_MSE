Application of explicit precautionary principles in data-limited
fisheries management
================

This repository ([GA_MSE_PA](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE_PA)) is
a mirror of [GA_MSE](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE) with the PA
branch displayed as default branch.

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for optimising the data-limited
empirical rfb rule ([ICES
WKMSYCat34](http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Expert%20Group%20Report/acom/2017/WKMSYCAT34/01.%20WKMSYCAT34%20REPORT%202017.pdf)
catch rule 3.2.1, [Fischer et al.,
2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsaa054)) with a genetic
algorithm. The simulation is based on the Fisheries Library in R
([FLR](http://www.flr-project.org/)) and the Assessment for All (a4a)
standard MSE framework ([`FLR/mse`](github.com/FLR/mse)) developed
during the Workshop on development of MSE algorithms with R/FLR/a4a
([Jardim et al.,
2017](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/assessment-all-initiativea4a-workshop-development-mse-algorithms-rflra4a)).

The `master` branch ([GA_MSE](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE))
contains the code for the publication:

> (2021). Using a genetic algorithm to optimise a data-limited catch
> rule. ICES Journal of Marine Science. 78: 1311-1323.
> <https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsab018>.

This is the **`PA branch`** which includes the optimisation with
specific risk limits for the ICES precautionary approach (PA) and
contains the code for the publication:

The `harvest_rate` branch
([GA_MSE_HR](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE_HR)) explores the use
of harvest rates and contains the code for the publication:

> data-limited fisheries management. ICES Journal of Marine Science. 12
> pp.Â <https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsac103>.

The operating models provided as an input are those from the repository
[shfischer/wklifeVII](https://github.com/shfischer/wklifeVII) as
described in:

> Fischer, S. H., De Oliveira, J. A. A., and Laurence T. Kell (2020).

## Repository structure

The code, input and output files from the master branch
([GA_MSE](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE)) are retained:

> The root folder contains the following R scripts:
>
> -   `OM.R`: This script creates the operating models (OMs),
> -   `funs.R` contains functions and methods used for the creation of
>     the operating models and for running the MSE,
> -   `funs_GA.R` contains the function used in the optimisation
>     procedure,
> -   `run_ms.R` is an R script for running MSE projections and is
>     called from a job submission script
> -   `run*.pbs` are job submission scripts which are used on a high
>     performance computing cluster and call `run_ms.R`
> -   `analysis.R` is for analysing the results
>
> The following input files are provided:
>
> -   `input/stocks.csv` contains the stock definitions and life-history
>     parameters

    results for pollack)
-   `run_PA*.pbs` are job submission scripts for the optimisation
    towards the precautionary approach

Also, the following summary tables are provided:

-   `pol_PA_sensitivity.csv`: summarised results from the sensitivity
    analysis for pollack

    `pol_PA_sensitivity_risk_100yrs.csv`: further results from the
    sensitivity analysis for pollack
-   `pol_PA_components_stats.csv`: exploration of including/excluding
    elements of the rfb rule into the optimisation for pollack
-   `all_stocks_PA_multiplier_stats.csv`: optimisation towards the PA
    with only the multiplier of the rfb rule for all stocks
-   `all_stocks_GA_optimised_stats.csv`: combined optimisation results
    of the rfb rule for the PA and MSY fitness functions
-   `all_stocks_2over_stats.csv`: results of the 2 over 3 rule for all
    stocks
-   `PA_summary_table_parameters.csv`: optimised rfb rule
    parameterisations

The framework is based on the Fisheries Library in R (FLR) framework.
The exact versions of the packages as used here can be installed with
`remotes`:

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/FLCore", ref = "3d694903b9e6717b86c3e8486fc14ebf92908786")
remotes::install_github(repo = "shfischer/FLash", ref = "d1fb86fa081aaa5b6980d74b07d9adb44ad19a7f", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch") # silenced version of FLash
# INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch" to avoid issues in Windows
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/FLBRP", ref = "3a4d6390abc56870575fbaba3637091036468217", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")
```

Furthermore, a data-limited fork of the `flr/mse` package is required:

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = "shfischer/mse", ref = "mseDL2.0", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")
```

And a modified version of the `GA` package for genetic algorithms which
also runs on HPCs and supports MPI parallelisation:

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = "shfischer/GA")
```

Furthermore, some more R packages available from CRAN are required:

``` r
install.packages(c("foreach", "DoParallel", "doRNG", "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "scales", "cowplot", "Cairo", "scales")) 
```

For using MPI parallelisation, an MPI backend such as OpenMPI and the R
packages `Rmpi` and `doMPI` are required.
