This is the branch used during WKLIFE 10 in 2020. Other branches might be more up to date and include more detailed descriptions.

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for testing empirical management procedures and optimising them with a genetic algorithm. The simulation is based on the Fisheries Library in R ([FLR](http://www.flr-project.org/)) and the Assessment for All (a4a) standard MSE framework ([`FLR/mse`](github.com/FLR/mse)) developed during the Workshop on development of MSE algorithms with R/FLR/a4a ([Jardim et al., 2017](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/assessment-all-initiativea4a-workshop-development-mse-algorithms-rflra4a)).

The [`master`](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE/tree/master) branch contains the code for optimising the rfb rule for the publication:

The [`PA`](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE/tree/PA) branch (mirrored at [`GA_MSE_PA`](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE_PA)) includes the optimisation of the rfb rule with specific risk limits for the ICES precautionary approach (PA) and contains the code for the publication:

> Fischer, S. H., De Oliveira, J. A. A., Mumford, J. D., and Kell, L. T. (2021). Application of explicit precautionary principles in data-limited fisheries management. ICES Journal of Marine Science. 78: 2931-2942. https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsab169.

The [`harvest_rate`](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE/tree/harvest_rate) branch (mirrored at [`GA_MSE_HR`](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE_HR)) contains the optimisation for the harvest rate rule.

The operating models provided as an input are those from the repository [shfischer/wklifeVII](https://github.com/shfischer/wklifeVII) as described in:

> Fischer, S. H., De Oliveira, J. A. A., and Laurence T. Kell (2020). Linking the performance of a data-limited empirical catch rule to life-history traits. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 77: 1914-1926. https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsaa054.

The framework is based on the Fisheries Library in R (FLR) framework. The exact versions of the packages as used here can be installed with `remotes`:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/FLCore", ref = "3d694903b9e6717b86c3e8486fc14ebf92908786")
remotes::install_github(repo = "shfischer/FLash", ref = "d1fb86fa081aaa5b6980d74b07d9adb44ad19a7f", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch") # silenced version of FLash
# INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch" to avoid issues in Windows
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/FLBRP", ref = "3a4d6390abc56870575fbaba3637091036468217", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")
```

Furthermore, a data-limited fork of the `flr/mse` package is required:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github(repo = "shfischer/mse", ref = "mseDL2.0", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")
```

And a modified version of the `GA` package for genetic algorithms which also runs on HPCs and supports MPI parallelisation:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github(repo = "shfischer/GA")
```

Furthermore, some more R packages available from CRAN are required:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("foreach", "DoParallel", "doRNG", "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "scales", "cowplot", "Cairo", "scales")) 
```

For using MPI parallelisation, an MPI backend such as OpenMPI and the R packages `Rmpi` and `doMPI` are required.
